# Description: Explain the following terms:
#              a. Abstraction (in programming)
#              b. Accessor and mutator methods
#              c. Public and private methods
#              d. __str__ method (in Python)

# a. Abstraction means hiding all except the relevant data of an object, 
#    whenever practical, from the user. This reduces complexity and 
#    increases efficiency.

# b. Accessor and mutator methods help access and alter internally stored 
#    data. Accessors (get methods) are used to access the data hidden in the 
#    obejct. They can't be used to change the data.
#    Mutators (set methods) are used to modify the hidden data.

# c. Private methods are used to hide the inner functionality of any class. 
#    Private methods should not be accessed outside the class or by any base 
#    class. Private methods are defined with "__" prefix.
#    Public methods are accessible from outside the class.

# d. The __str__ method represents the class ojects as a string. It is usually 
#    used for classes. It should be defined so that it's easy to read and it 
#    outputs all the members of the class.
