# Description: Code a simple (and textual) implementation of 
#              Rock-Paper-Scissors game. Best of 3 games wins. Plan your game 
#              first and code piece by piece: read input from user, generate 
#              random number to get computerâ€™s choice, then check who wins and 
#              keep track of victories. Use functions.
