# 1. Explain the following term and what is it used for: a. Multiple inheritance
#    A class that is derived from more than one base class is called multiple 
#    inheritance. All the features of the base classes are inherited to the 
#    derived class. Multiple inheritance is used to add functionality that 
#    might not be part of the logical class relationships.

# 2. True or false?
#    a. The practice of procedural programming is centered on the creation 
#       of objects. FALSE
#    b. Object reusability has been a factor in the increased use of 
#       object-oriented programming. TRUE
#    c. It is a common practice in object-oriented programming to make all of 
#       a classâ€™s data attributes accessible to statements outside the class. FALSE
#    d. A class methods does not have to have a self parameter. FALSE
#    e. Starting an attribute name with two underscores will hide the attribute 
#       from code outside the class. TRUE
#    f. You cannot directly call the __str__method. TRUE

# 3. Multiple choice:
#    a. The ___ method is automatically called when an object is created.
#       i. __init__
#    b. The ___ programming practice is centered on creating functions that are 
#       separated from the data that they work on.
#       ii. procedural
#    c. The ___ programming practice iscentered on creating objects.
#       iv. object-oriented
#    d. A(n) ___ is a component of a class that references data.
#       iii. data attribute
#    e. By doing this, you can hide a class's attribute from code outside the class.
#       iii. begin the name of the attribute with two underscores
#    f. A(n) ___ method stores a value in the data attribute or changes its value 
#       in some way.
#       iii. mutator
