# Description: Imagine you would have to code a simple alarm clock (shows time 
#              and alarms you at certain time you can set). Which data 
#              attributes will you have? Do the attributes have some value 
#              restrictions? You should find at least 5 data attributes. Which 
#              methods would you need? Which methods should be public and 
#              which ones should be private?

# Attributes: hours 0-24, minutes 0-60, seconds 0-60, alarm_time, 
#             on_off for each alarm
# Methods: set_alarm_hours, set_alarm_minutes, set_alarm_seconds, 
#          set_alarm on/off, show_time, these all are public
