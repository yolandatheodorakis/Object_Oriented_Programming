# Description: Explain the following terms: 
#              a. Pseudocode
#              b. Algorithm
#              c. Data attribute
#              d. Method

# a. Pseudocode means code written in plain language rather than any coding 
#    language. It has no syntax so computers can't read it but any person can 
#    without much coding knowledge.

# b. An algorithm uses a set of rules or instructions to solve a problem or 
#    to perform a computation.

# c. Data attribute stores custom data, for example every object has 
#    attributes like name, age etc.

# d. Method is similar to a function. It is a subroutine attached to a 
#    specific class and it can only be called by an object created from 
#    the class.
