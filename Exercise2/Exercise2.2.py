# Description: Take a look at the courseâ€™s assessment (number of accepted 
#              exercises meaning certain grade). Write pseudocode for a 
#              program where user inputs the number of accepted exercises and 
#              program prints out the grade. Use informative and readable 
#              output prints. 

#   function get_grade:
#       ask user to input the number of accepted exercises

#       if user's input is smaller than 9:
#           print: grade is 0

#       if user's input is 9:
#           print: grade is 1

#       if user's input is 10:
#           print: grade is 2

#       if user's input is 11:
#           print: grade is 3

#       if user's input is 12:
#           print: grade is 4

#       if user's input is 13:
#           print: grade is 5
