# Description: Write pseudocode for a program that accepts studentâ€™s name and 
#              grade as input and counts the average of grades of all students. 
#              If you have difficulties, you can fix the number of students to 
#              e.g. 5. Print out the average. Use informative and readable 
#              output prints.

#   function count_average:
#        while the number of students is under 6:
#            ask the user to input name and grade

#            count the sum of all grades into a variable

#            count the average and save into a variable

#       print what the average is
